Description:
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Random Forest algorithm for stock prediction. Random Forest is a popular ensemble learning method that can be used for both classification and regression tasks, making it suitable for predicting stock prices.

Introduction
Stock prediction is a challenging task due to the complex and volatile nature of financial markets. Machine learning techniques, such as the Random Forest algorithm, have been widely employed to forecast stock prices based on historical data and relevant features.

The Random Forest algorithm works by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mean prediction of the individual trees for regression tasks or the mode prediction for classification tasks. This ensemble approach helps reduce overfitting and improve the accuracy of predictions.

This repository provides a straightforward implementation of the Random Forest algorithm specifically tailored for stock prediction tasks. By leveraging historical stock data and relevant financial indicators, the algorithm aims to forecast future price movements, providing valuable insights for investors and traders.
